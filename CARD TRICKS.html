        <h2>Technique</h2>
        <p>Illusions performed with playing cards are constructed using basic card manipulation techniques (or
            sleights). It is the intention of the performer that such sleights are performed in a manner which is
            undetectable to the audience—however, that result takes practice and a thorough understanding of method
            Manipulation techniques include:</p>
        <h2>Lifts</h2>
        <p>Lifts are techniques which extract one or more cards from a deck. The produced card(s) are normally known to
            the audience, for example having previously been selected or identified as part of the illusion. In sleight
            of hand, a "double lift" can be made to extract two cards from the deck, but held together to appear as one
            card.</p>
        <h2>False deals</h2>
        <p>Dealing cards (for example at the start of a traditional card game) is considered a fair means of
            distributing cards. False deals are techniques which appear to deliver cards fairly, when actually the cards
            delivered are predetermined or known to the performer. False dealing techniques include: second dealing,
            bottom dealing, middle dealing, false counts (more or less cards are dealt than expected), and double
            dealing (the top and bottom cards of a small packet are dealt together). </p>
        <h2>Side slips</h2>
        <p>A technique generally used to bring a predetermined card to the top of a deck, or the second card from the
            top of the deck. Depth-perception plays a key role, since it is obvious where card placement happens
            otherwise. One of such techniques is known as the Marlo tilt.</p>
        <h2>Passes</h2>
        <p>The effect of the card pass is that an identified card is inserted somewhere into a deck,is causes to
            secretly change its place from the middle to any where in the deck . This is accomplished by following rapid
            and concealed hand manipulation of both hands by the performer, it is then revealed to be on the top (or
            bottom) of the deck or anywhere else in the deck without shuffling or cutting the deck. A pass is achieved
            by swapping the portion of the deck from the identified card downwards, with the portion of the deck above
            the identified card. Pass techniques include: the invisible turn-over pass, the Zingone Perfect Table pass,
            the flesh grip pass, the jog pass, the Braue pass, the Charlier pass, the finger palm pass and the Hermann
            pass. Simply, a card pass is a secret cut of the deck (not to be confused with a coin pass which is a false
            transfer of a coin from one hand to the other).</p>
        <h2>Palming</h2>
        <p>Palming is a technique for holding or concealing one or more cards. Cards palmed from a deck are typically
            held in reserve (unseen by the audience) until production is required for the illusion being performed.
            Palming techniques include: the Braue diagonal tip-up, the swing, the thumb-count, face card palm, the
            crosswise, new vertical, the gamblers' squaring, the gamblers' flat, the Hugard top palm, the flip-over, the
            Hofzinser bottom, the Braue bottom, the Tenkai palm and the Zingone bottom.</p>
        <h2>False shuffles</h2>
        <p>Shuffling cards is considered a fair means to randomize the cards contained in a deck. False shuffles are
            techniques which appear to fairly shuffle a deck, when actually the cards in the deck are maintained in an
            order appropriate to the illusion being performed. False shuffles can be performed that permit one or more
            cards to be positioned in a deck, or even for the entire deck to remain in an unshuffled state (for example
            the state the deck was in before the shuffle). False shuffle techniques include: the perfect riffle, the
            strip-out, the Hindu shuffle, the gamblers', and various stock shuffling techniques (where the locations of
            one or more cards are controlled during the false shuffle)</p>
        <h2>False cuts</h2>
        <p>Cutting a deck of cards is a technique whereby the deck is split into two portions (the split point being
            randomly determined – often by a member of the audience), which are then swapped – the effect being to make
            sure that no one is sure of which card is on the top of the deck. False cuts are techniques whereby the
            performer appears to organise a fair cut, when actually a predetermined card (or cards) is organised to be
            located on the top of the deck. False cutting techniques include: the false running cut, and the gambler's
            false cut <b>CLICK ON THE LINK BELOW </b>TO LEARN THE FALSE CUT <br /><a href="TUTORIAL.html"

        <h2>Color change</h2>
        <p>A color change is the effect of changing one card to another in front of the spectators eyes. There are many
            different techniques to accomplish this effect, but among the most common are the classic color change and
            the snap change, due to them being easier to master than others; professional magicians usually deign to
            perform other color changes while teaching the mentioned color changes to the layperson. Usually the cards
            changed are of different colors, such as a red into a black or a court card into a number card, in order to
            make the change more visual. Separating red and black cards is a variation of the "sensitive fingertips"
            trick. <b>LEARN EASY COLOR CHANGE </b> CLICK ON THE LINK BELOW <br /> <a href="TUTORIAL.html"

        <h2>Crimps</h2>
        <p>Crimps are techniques whereby part of a card is intentionally physically marked, creased, or bent to
            facilitate identification during an illusion. Crimp techniques include: the regular crimp, the gamblers'
            crimp, the breather crimp and the peek crimp</p>
        <h2>Jogs</h2>
        <p>A jog is one or more cards which protrude slightly from somewhere within a deck or stack of cards. The
            protrusion, although not noticeable to the audience, permits the performer to retain knowledge about the
            location of the card during other manipulations. While jogs are not always hidden from the audience, they
            are most often. Some varieties include 'in jogs', 'side jogs', and 'out jogs'</p>
        <h2>Reverses</h2>
        <p>Card reverses are techniques whereby one or more cards in a deck are made to change their direction, for
            example from face up to face down.</p>
        <h2>Forces</h2>
        <p>Card forces are the sleight which involves forcing a spectator to choose a card that has been predetermined
            by the performer, while maintaining supposed free choice. Some forces include; the classic force, the riffle
            force, and the slip force.</p>
